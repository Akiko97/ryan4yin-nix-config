# Idols - Ruby

TODO: use ruby for backup / sync my personal data, and monitor the status/logs of my homelab.
For safety, those data should be encrypted before sending to the cloud or my NAS.

1. prometheus: Monitor the status of my homelab
1. restic: Backup file from homelab to NAS, or from NAS to Cloud
1. synthing: Sync file between android/macbook/PC and NAS
