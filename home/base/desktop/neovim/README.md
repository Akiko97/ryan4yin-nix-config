# AstroNvim

My Neovim config based on AstroNvim.

## TODO

- [ ] let Mason use the binaries installed by nix!
    - currenty some plugins(markdown/clangd/...) failed to start due to this problem.
    - Temporary solution: `rm ~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/*`, but do not remove `emmet-ls`, cause it's not found in nixpkgs!
