# AstroNvim

My Neovim config based on AstroNvim.

## TODO

- [ ] Install language servers, formatters, and others via nix home manager, instead of mason.nvim!
    - currently some plugins(markdown/clangd/...) failed to start due to this problem.
    - Temporary solution: `rm ~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/*`, but do not remove `emmet-ls`, cause it's not found in nixpkgs!
